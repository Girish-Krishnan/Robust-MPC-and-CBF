# RL + Robust MPC and CBF

Implementing robust model-predictive control (MPC) and a control barrier function (CBF) safety filter, to improve the safety and performance of reinforcement learning (RL)-based autonomous systems.

## Directory Structure

- `Intro_Robust_MPC/`: Contains a basic tutorial on robust MPC and its Python implementation.
- `Autonomous_Racing/`: Implements robust MPC and CBF for an autonomous racing car environment, i.e. an F1TENTH car.
- `Drone_Landing/`: Implements robust MPC and CBF for a drone landing task.
